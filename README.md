## Master Thesis 1:  MODELING OF GEOPHYSICAL RESERVOIR IN POROUS MEDIUM

### Abstract:
Modelling of reservoir in porous medium conducted in this work aims to contribute to the improvement and the optimization of natural recovery or assisted fluids in porous medium. In this work, we have presented, a theory on reservoir and porous medium also some physical models of reservoir. The models of reservoir in porous medium are generally represented by partial derivative equations systems. These systems of equations are solved by numerical methods according to some parameters and of boundary conditions. For simulations, the difficulties such as, dimensions of reservoir, the taking into account of the miscibility and the compressibility of fluids like thus the heterogeneity of the media are met. In our case, we are interested in a model of reservoir containing an immiscible and incompressible flow, in a homogeneous medium and having applications in hydrogeology and Oil industries. That led to a system of equations given by the conservation laws of mass and by the Darcy’s laws which was solved by analytical method and the finite differences according to the type of model. The first system is obtained by considering a model of capillary tube and is solved analytically. The second system is obtained by considering a model of porous networks, it is solved numerically by the method of finites differences for obtaining models. From this work, it arises that, when all the borders of the reservoir are impermeable, the fluid is trapped there and when the horizontal or vertical borders are at imposed pressures, the fluid moves in a well-known direction in the réservoir.

## Master Thesis 2: THE ANALYSIS OF SHUTTLE-TANKER AND FLOATING STORAGE OFFLOADING DURING BERTHING OPERATIONS AT OFFSHORE NIGERIA, IN RESPONSE TO SOLITON AND SQUALL EVENTS

### Abstract: 
Metocean phenomena such as internal solitary waves (ISWs) or solitons , strong highly variable
ocean currents and squall can seriously disrupt offshore exploration, development and offloading
operations. Statistical analysis of data taken on a oil platform and on a floating storage offloading
(FSO), Offshore Nigeria from 12 March 2013 to 27 August 2014, has carried out existence and
propagation of solitons and squalls in oil platform field. There are recorded 273 soliton events
which likely move from the oil platform to FSO in 1 hour 45 minutes on average, and 95 squall
events with a mean rise time of wind speed of 14 minutes. FSO and shuttle tanker responses
were studied through analysis of global position system (GPS), heading and mooring hawser
tension data. There are founded some periods where the response was violent as on 24 April
2014, where hawser tension increases up to 235 tons. There also are founded an occurrence of
tanker’s mooring hawsers breaking due to strong soliton event, which occurs on 20 December
2013. Proposals for prediction of these phenomena and violent response of FSO and responses
to these events were made.
